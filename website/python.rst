What is Python?
---------------

Python is a modern, multi-paradigm, programming language that is increasingly used for scientific computation.

Why not Matlab?
---------------

Matlab is a good solution for data exploration. If you are using its command-line directly, it is very convenient. In fact, many of the tools covered in this class are inspired (or, at the very least, influenced by Matlab). However, the moment you save commands to a file, I would argue you are writing software (even if on a small scale). For this, Matlab is less apropriate.

In part, the same characteristics that make it a convenient tool when used directly, make it unusable for even small scale software projects. For example, the flat namespace, or the fact that each function corresponds to a file. In this sense, it is similar to an Unix shell: fast to use if you're typing commands directly, but not scalable.

Matlab is still, at its core, a matrix processing language. For matrix processing, its expressive power is unmatched, at the cost of forcing everything else to conform to it.
