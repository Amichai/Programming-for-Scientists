If you do use these in a class, I would appreciate it if you dropped me a note with any comments/corrections. Thank you.

Everything in these pages, including lecture slides and lecture notes, is by Lu√≠s Pedro Coelho, except where otherwise noted.


Availability

I will make the source code to all of this class (including LaTeX source to slides and notes) available at the end of the semester. If you'd like it earlier, just let me know.
