If you are using Linux, then I recommend you get the Python packages that are standard for your distribution. Be sure to look for the numpy and scipy packages as well (in ubuntu, they're called *python-numpy* and *python-scipy*). *Python-matplotlib* includes the very useful *matplotlib* library.

Enthought Python Distribution is a Python distribution specially targetted for scientific applications. It's a commercial product, but free for students (like you). All the sotware it includes is open-source, but it's nice to have a single distribution (especially if you are not using a Linux distribution that does that work for you).  Python(x,y) is similar, but for Windows only (*Linux version available soon*, but on Linux, follow the advice above and use your Linux distribution's installation).  

Mac OS X includes a version of Python with the numpy & scipy libraries (they're, I'm told, on a separate CD). If you are using 10.5, this should suffice for this course. If you are using an older version, you might consider upgrading using one of the distributions above (like Enthought's)

Python IDEs (integrated development environments):
    * Eclipse_ (see also PyDev_)
    * Stani_
    * DrPython_
    * KomodoIDE_
    * Ipython_
    * MacPython_ (for Mac OS X)
    * Also, you can use editors like Emacs and vi(m), of course
