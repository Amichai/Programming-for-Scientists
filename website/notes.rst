Enthought is a Python distribution specially targetted for scientific applications. It's a commercial product, but free for students (like you). All the sotware it includes is open-source, but it's nice to have a single distribution (especially if you are not using a Linux distribution that does that work for you).

Python IDEs (integrated development environments):
    * Eclipse_ (see also PyDev_)
    * Stani_
    * DrPython_
    * KomodoIDE_
    * Ipython_
    * MacPython_ (for Mac OS X)
    * Also, you can use editors like Emacs and vi(m), of course
