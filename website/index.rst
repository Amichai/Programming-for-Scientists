Programming for Scientists
======================================================

Who is this class for?
----------------------
This course is for scientists who find that they spend a lot of time programming but who have never had a formal introduction to programming. Many have picked up programming (often using a language such as Matlab) and find a way to *manage*. However, the results are not as good as they could be.

This course is also for you if you want to learn how to program. You will need to attend an extra lecture and so some extra homework at the beginning of the course.

Who teaches it?
---------------

This is a *student taught* course, taught by Lu√≠s Pedro Coelho, a third-year Ph.D. student in Computational Biology.
