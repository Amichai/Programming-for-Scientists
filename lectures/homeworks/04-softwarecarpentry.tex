\question % 1
Alice and Bob are pair-programming again. This time, Alice writes the following code:

\begin{python}
print 'Error: file format unrecognised.'
\end{python}

Bob suggests that, since this is an error, it should be 

\begin{python}
import sys
...

print >>sys.stderr, 'Error: file format unrecognised.'
\end{python}

Alice argues ``Both go to the screen when I run the program, so printing errors to \lstinline{sys.stderr} is just being pedantic.'' Bob says ``Well, if you run it directly, both stdout and stderr go to the screen, but you can redirect stdout or pipe it to some other program and then it makes a big difference.''

What is Bob talking about? (You can simply give an example of where things work differently if you use Bob or Alice's version.)
