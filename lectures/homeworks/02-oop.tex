\question

\chapter{Programming Assignment}

Consider the competing bacteria environment from class. Consider the following reasoning:

\begin{quote}
Species that change the speed of mutation do better when the environment changes fast. Species that mutate slowly do better when the environment is fixed. Therefore, the best would be specie that sense its own adaptation and mutates more when it is not adapted to the enviroment.
\end{quote}

Your assignment is to 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Formulate a reasonable mathematical implementation of the idea above.
\item Implement it in Python. For this, download the file \textit{bacteria.py} from the website (this is the code used in lecture) and extend it. You \textbf{should not} change the code in the function \textit{simulate_population}! You should simply implement a new type of bacteria.
\end{enumerate}
