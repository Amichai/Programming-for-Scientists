This week, you get fewer questions and a longer programming assignment.

\chapter{Questions}

\question % 1
What is a local minimum? Is there any way to find out whether you are in a local minimum?

\question % 2
Newton's method is originally defined as solving for zero (i.e., solving $f(x) = 0$), but it was presented as solving a maximisation problem (i.e., $\max f(x)$). What's happening?

\chapter{Programming Assignment}

(1) Implement any method you'd like to find a numerical minimum to:

\begin{equation}
f(x) = x^6-7x^4+3x^3+2x^2-3x.
\end{equation}

(2) Use a pre-written method for the same task (like those in \lstinline{scipy.optimize}).
