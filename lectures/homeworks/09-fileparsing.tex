\question
What is a text file?

\question
What does it mean to say that a file has ``Unix line endings''?

\question
What does the following regular expression match?

\begin{python}
import re
pattern = re.compile(r'\d{2}-\d{2}-\d{2,4}')
\end{python}

This uses functionality not covered in class. Look up the \texttt{re} module.

\chapter{Programming Assignment}

The following is the start of a file containing sparse arrays of numbers:

\begin{verbatim}
100 13
1:0.7 2:1 3:1 4:-0.3 7:-0.1
1:0.5 2:-1 3:0.333333 6:-0.603774 10:1
1:0.1 2:1 4:-0.333334 5:-0.433962 9:-0.383562 6:-1
1:0.4 2:1 4:1 4:-0.358491 10:0.374429 11:-1 12:-1
2:-1 3:-0.333333 4:-0.509434 5:-0.347032 6:-1 7:1
1:0.5 2:1 3:1 4:-0.509434 5:-0.767123 6:-1 7:-1 8:0.0534351
\end{verbatim}

The exact format is as follows: the first line has two numbers: the number of arrays and the length of each array. Each subsequent line represents an array. The array is represented as a space-separated list of pairs \textit{idx:value} where \textit{idx} is the index on an entry and \textit{value} is its value. Entries without a value are zero. For example, the first array is $(.7,1,1,-0.3,0,0,-.1,0,0,0,0,0,0)$

Write a function that parses this file and returns a numpy array with the values.
