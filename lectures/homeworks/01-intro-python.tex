\question
Alice and Bob were doing some \textit{pair programming}\footnote{Pair programming is when two programmers write code together. Normally, one will sit at the computer typing with the other will look over his shoulder to make sure he isn't making any mistakes. After a while, they switch.

You might consider pair programming to help with this class.} and Alice wrote the following code:

\begin{python}
value = 100
interest = 5
value *= (1. + interest)

print 'Value after interest:', value
\end{python}

Bob argued that this would never work. ``In Python, numbers are immutable. In the line \textit{value *= (1. + interest)}, you are changing the value of \textit{value}. However, when they try it out, it works. Where is the mistake in Bob's reasoning?
