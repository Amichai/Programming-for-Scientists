\question
Which function returns the number of elements in a list?

\question
How do

\question
Alice and Bob were doing some \textit{pair programming}\footnote{Pair programming is when two programmers write code together. Normally, one will sit at the computer typing with the other will look over his shoulder to make sure he isn't making any mistakes. After a while, they switch.

You might consider pair programming to help with assignments in this class.} and Alice wrote the following code:

\begin{python}
value = 100
interest = 5
value *= (1. + interest)

print 'Value after interest:', value
\end{python}

Bob argued that this would never work. ``In Python, numbers are immutable. In the line \textit{value *= (1. + interest)}, you are changing the value of \textit{value}. However, when they try it out, it works as Alice expected. Where is the mistake in Bob's reasoning? Are numbers mutable after all?

\chapter{Programming Assignment}

You are considering whether to enroll in a couple of different saving plans. You put some money in now and deduct some initial fee, you put in some money every month, interest accrues each month and accumulates. How much money would you have after 5 years?

\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
\toprule
Plan Name & Fee & Initial Amount & Monthly Amount & Interest \\
\midrule
Low-fee & 0 & 0 & 100 & .2\% \\
Low-interest & 20 & 100 & 50 & .02\% \\
High-initial & 100 & 1000 & 50 & .2\% \\
High-monthly & 100 & 0 & 250 & .2\% \\
High-interest & 100 & 0 & 100 & .4\% \\
