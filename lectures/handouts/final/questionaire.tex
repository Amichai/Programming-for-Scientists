Please fill out this survey. This will help me understand what was good and bad about this class. Try to be as precise and complete as possible. The surveys are anonymous, but I may make some results of it public.

\chapter{Overall}
Did this class fulfill your expectations?
\begin{itemize}[\checkbox]
\item It surpassed them by a mile.
\item It surpassed them.
\item It fulfilled my expectations.
\item I was a bit disappointed.
\item It was a total waste of my time.
\end{itemize}

The goal of this class was to make you 20\% more productive. How would you estimate the productivity increase from the methods and tools you learnt?
\begin{itemize}[\checkbox]
\item I'm actually a worse programmer now.
\item Zero.
\item Just a bit, less than 20\%.
\item Around 20\%.
\item More than 20\%.
\item More than twice as productive.
\end{itemize}

If you replied ``Zero'' or ``Just a bit,'' why do you think so:

\begin{itemize}[\checkbox]
\item I still haven't gone over the initial energy barrier of using new tools, but I think they are going to be helpful in the future.
\item The tools don't help with the kind of problems I work on.
\item I didn't really understand what was being taught.
\end{itemize}

\section{Expectations}
Here are the particular expectations that I had listed on the website. Let me know if you think that you fulfill them:

    (i) Software carpentry: source control, unit testing, profilers. Students should know how to use Subversion, nosetest, and the Python profiler as well as understand the concepts behind these tools (which will enable them to use them with a different implementation).

\begin{itemize}[\checkbox]
\item I understand this perfectly.
\item I understand most of it.
\item I have a vague idea.
\item I don't really get it.
\item What are you talking about?
\end{itemize}
Additional comments:

    (ii) Modern programming paradigms: object oriented. Students should know how polymorphism works and understand when and why it can be useful.
\begin{itemize}[\checkbox]
\item I understand this perfectly.
\item I understand most of it.
\item I have a vague idea.
\item I don't really get it.
\item What are you talking about?
\end{itemize}
Additional comments:

    (iii) Students should know how floating-point numbers are represented and their limitations. Detailed knowledge of specific formats is not required.
\begin{itemize}[\checkbox]
\item I understand this perfectly.
\item I understand most of it.
\item I have a vague idea.
\item I don't really get it.
\item What are you talking about?
\end{itemize}
Additional comments:

    (iv) Technologies: Python including numpy. Students should be able to confortably write medium-sized programs (a few thousand lines of code) using these technologies in an effective way.

\begin{itemize}[\checkbox]
\item I understand this perfectly.
\item I understand most of it.
\item I have a vague idea.
\item I don't really get it.

\chapter{Homeworks \& Project}

Did you think that the homeworks were a good use of your time?
\begin{itemize}[\checkbox]
\item Yes, they helped a lot.
\item Generally helpful.
\item Mixed bag.
\item Mostly a waste of time.
\item Not helpful---just something more to do.
\end{itemize}

Is the project getting you to understand the material better?
\begin{itemize}[\checkbox]
\item Yes, is helping a lot.
\item Generally helpful.
\item Mixed bag.
\item Mostly a waste of time.
\item Not helpful---just something more to do.
\item I haven't worked enough on the project to answer this question.
\end{itemize}
