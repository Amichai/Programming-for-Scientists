Programming for Scientists is a course for scientists (biologists, physicists, ...) who find themselves programming without having had a formal introduction to the practice of programming. Students who want to learn programming from scratch are welcome and will be accommodated through two extra lectures at the start of the course.

The goal is to make students more effective programmers, who spend less time doing it, who write code that is more efficient, more readable, and has less bugs. For the practical part of the course, the Python programming language will be covered. Python is a modern language which is increasingly used for scientific programming.
